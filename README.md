Run main.py, it will execute the code defined in that script, which includes setting up logging and calling the web 
scraping logic from scraper.py.

In provided code structure:

main.py: This script is intended to serve as an entry point for project. When you run main.py, it will configure 
logging using the functions from utils.py and then call the scrape_all_jobs function from scraper.py. 
This, in turn, will execute the web scraping logic.
So, by running main.py, you should achieve the entire process, including logging setup and web scraping.

The csv_writer.py script, as provided in the context of this conversation, is responsible for coordinating the 
web scraping, data extraction, and writing the results to a CSV file.
When you run csv_writer.py, it initiates the web scraping process, extracts data from job listings, and then saves 
the data along with job URLs to the output.csv file.
